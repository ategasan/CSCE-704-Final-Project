# CSCE-704-Final-Project

Image-tampering using Artificial Intelligence is becoming more prevalent in society. While the common focus is on fake scenarios of public figures, a less common, but concerning possibility is medical-image tampering. This research focuses on the detection of tampering of CT scans, specifically when cancer has been added or removed from the lung scans. This research trains a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network to focus on the normal features in medical CT scans of lungs, and uses that to detect subtle changes that are indicative of tampering. In addition to regular training, this research incorporates adversarial training and includes images with legitimate medical adjustments. This improves the model’s robustness, by allowing it to differentiate between normal modifications and malicious tampering. This combination can help improve confidence in medical imaging, especially in cases where it is difficult for radiologists and healthcare professionals to detect.
